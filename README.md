# 🧰 Side Skills Playground

Welcome to my **Side Skills** repo!

This is my sandbox for exploring tools, technologies, and protocols that complement my main Rust journey — everything from system internals to infrastructure and tooling.

## 🌱 What you'll find here

You'll find projects I’ve built while learning or experimenting with:

🧪 Low-level systems concepts  
🛰️ Networking protocols  
📦 Containerization tools  
🔄 Event streaming  
🗃️ In-memory data stores  
🌐 Web servers  
🧠 Interpreters and parsers  
...and anything else that sharpens my dev edge.

Most of these are built by hand — sometimes following challenges like **CodeCrafters**, sometimes entirely from scratch.

## 🚀 Why this repo exists

This is not a polished production-ready repo.  
It’s a **learning lab** — a place to break things, rebuild them, and understand how they work under the hood.

It helps me:
- Deepen my Rust skills through real-world problems  
- Demystify complex tools by rebuilding them  
- Document what I learn as I go  

## 📌 Note

Projects may live in folders named after the topic, protocol, or tool explored.  
Expect CLI tools, barebones services, and protocol re-implementations.
